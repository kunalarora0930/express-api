## Introduction

The Express API project is a web application built using Node.js and Express.js framework. It serves as a backend API for various client applications to interact with. The project follows RESTful principles and allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on specific resources.

The API project provides a flexible foundation for building various types of web applications, such as mobile apps, web services, or any other application that requires server-side functionality.

## Installation

To install and run the Express API project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
- git clone https://github.com/kunalarora0930/express-api.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
- cd express-api-project
3. Install the dependencies:
-npm install
4. Start the application:
- npm start


The API server will start running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

The Express API project exposes various endpoints that can be accessed using HTTP methods like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`. These endpoints allow users to perform operations on the available resources.

To use the API, you can make requests using tools like `curl`, Postman, or any programming language with HTTP request capabilities.

Ensure you set the appropriate headers and include necessary authentication tokens, if required, to access protected endpoints.

## API Endpoints

The API project defines the following endpoints:

- **`GET /users/`**: Retrieves a list of all users.
- **`GET /users/:id`**: Retrieves a specific user by its ID.
- **`POST /users/`**: Creates a new resource.
- **`PATCH /users/:id`**: Updates a specific resource by its ID.
- **`DELETE /users/:id`**: Deletes a specific resource by its ID.
